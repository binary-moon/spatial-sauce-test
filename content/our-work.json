A dynamic “petal path” guided them to the next offer box and  encouraged them to seek and unlock more offers, promoting footfall and dwell time.</p><p>Finally, we have activated the giant screen via three Japanese inspired gamified experiences, using our unique platform combining augmented reality, skeletal and gesture tracking, depth mapping and artificial intelligence-driven live characters.</p><p>These experiences were wildly popular, hosting up to a hundred engaged users at the busiest sessions, leading to an average of 7,500 active and passive engagements per day.</p>"

Many shopping centres install  physical “Santa Letter Mailboxes” to capitalise on this existing user behaviour, to create goodwill within the community as well as  footfall into the property. However, this age-old activity lacks an “instant reward” mechanism that today’s audiences crave.<p>Santa’s Magical Mailbox  is created to change that, and to add a fun and “magical” instant reward mechanic to the process; one that attracts and engages family audiences. Combined with the in-built Santa Photos mechanic, it’s the perfect Christmas installation for any size Centre!<p>At the heart of it is a custom built “post office” with an embedded screen and a custom mailbox equipped with a special scanner. As the kids drop their letter into the mailbox, it’s scanned and digitized in real time.<p>Then the very letter they just dropped in appears as a part of the virtual content that starts playing within the screen. They can magically see it go through its journey from the mailbox to Santa’s Mailroom, or even all the way to Santa’s hands via the cheeky Elf!  This gives the child an instant gratification, as well as a magical “sneak peek” into the inner workings of Santa’s Magical Kingdom, making the whole process of sending a letter feel so very real.<p>The kiosk also doubles as a virtual Santa Photo Booth, allowing visitors to take photos with Santa in a fun and lighthearted way. Once this mode is activated, Santa appears on the big screen as an augmented reality video live character, and encourages the users to take four photos with him. It’s designed to work just for one person or the whole family, in a very versatile approach.<p>Santa shows them fun poses to do, and once they strike the pose, a photo is taken automatically. At the end of  the sequence, the users can download the four shots they have with Santa to their mobiles using the provided on screen QR code and share to their socials directly. This no-touch and fun way of doing Santa photos is a great alternative for Santa sets, especially in the Covid era.</p>"

We have applied live real time AI training models on pre-existing footage due to the logistical reasons on the day.</p><p>“Highfive-o-meter” activation was designed as an icebreaker and a fun team building experience, where the AI rates the quality of the high fives the team members give each other and ranks them against each other, with an irreverent slap-stick execution.</p><p>“Live room” activation was a live camera set in the ballroom, which monitored the team while they were having post conference drinks and provided live reporting on items such as number of people, sentiment in the room, most popular outfit colors etc.</p><p>Utilising some of the most advanced technologies of our times for fun and entertaining experiences via pitch perfect creative ideation is what we live for; so, this was a project we loved to work on, and had lots of fun doing so.</p>"
